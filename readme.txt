1 - About
====
BoxOfRocks is a silly little Java program that has allowed me to dive deeply
into the depths of object oriented programming.  Basically it consists of a
community of rocks that communicate with each other and share information.

So BoxOfRocks gives you the opportunity to interact with a number of other
rocks and share information with them.  Currently, you can only interact
with computer rocks or "bot rocks."  For the final version, I hope to build
a server environment that will allow you to share information with rocks
that other people have created. -- And I did.  Go me.  It has a GUI too...
Enjoy!

2 - Use
====
You should find "start-server.bat" and "start-client.bat" files in the root of 
your crisp new BoxOfRocks folder.  If you execute them, it should start the 
program right up.

Once you start the program, you will need to create a new rock. Then, you 
will need to type in an IP for a BoxOfRocks server.  It defaults to localhost.
If you don't have a server available, just start up the provided server and 
enter a blank for the IP address.  After that, you will be presented with a 
series of menus that allow you to move around the "Rock Garden" and interact 
with fellow rocks.
